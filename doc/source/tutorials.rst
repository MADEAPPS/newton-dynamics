Tutorials
=========

This "Starter Kit" is for people who have never used Newton before.

The examples are self contained and strive to be as short as possible to
demonstrate the feature. Consequently, the examples lack all bells and
whistles, including error checks, automated Makefiles, or 3D graphics... you
have been warned :)

.. note::
   The tutorials were developed on Kubuntu 16.04, but should run on all
   platforms supported by Newton.
