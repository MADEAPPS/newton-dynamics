Newton dynamics is a realistic, cross-platform physics simulation library. It can easily be integrated into games and game engines and provides top of its class performance and simulation stability.
Ongoing development and a permissive license makes Newton Dynamics a top choice for all kinds of projects from scientific projects to game engines.

Compiling Newton
================

## Windows and OSX
Project files for Visual Studio and XCode are provided, mainly

* Newton Core: [coreLibrary_300/projects/](coreLibrary_300/projects/)
* packages: [packages/projects/](packages/projects/)
* demo sandbox: [applications/demosSandbox/projects/](applications/demosSandbox/projects/)

## Linux
There are Unix makefiles in the project folders mentioned above, but it is *highly* recommended to use CMake instead.

Newton Core does not have any third party dependencies.

To build the demo sandbox the following packages need to be installed:
* OpenGL
* glfw3
* OpenAL
* TinyXML

All of these should be available on any major Linux distribution (with associated `-dev` or `-devel` packages).

Alternatively they can be found in the folder [packages/thirdParty/](packages/thirdParty/) and built from source.
